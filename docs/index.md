## What is AWS DeepRacer?

AWS DeepRacer is the fastest way to get rolling with reinforcement learning (RL), literally, with a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning, 3D racing simulator, and a global racing league. Developers can train, evaluate, and tune RL models in the online simulator, deploy their models onto AWS DeepRacer for a real-world autonomous experience and compete in the AWS DeepRacer League for a chance to win the AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup.
