## Briefing Session

Date and time:  

Value: Innovation Wing [Where is Innovation Wing?](https://innowings.engg.hku.hk/innowing1/contact/)

## Rules

1. You may only compete with your own Reinforcement Learning models
2. The sharing and the use of shared models are strictly prohibited and will result in disqualification.
3. Submissions of models are only allowed during the contest period, sufficient proof of original authorship is required to be submitted along with the model.
4. A maximum submission of 2 models per person is allowed, if more than 2 models are submitted, only the latest two models submitted within the submission period will be considered.
5. To be qualified for the final leaderboard, your model will have to complete at least 3 full consecutive laps, if the model does not, the model will be disqualified.
6. The race will be conducted in the time trial format, with winners determined as the fastest time on the leaderboard at the end of the race.
7. In case of your model going out of the track (2 + wheels on the green part of the track at the same time), the lap will not be considered as valid.
8. The end of a lap is defined as the instance when the front wheel of the vehicle touches the finish line, which is the same way the lap starts initially.
9. A total of 9 laps will be run for each model, a reset will be triggered when the vehicle is off track (2 + wheels on the green part of the track at the same time ) and will be counted as 1 lap, the best 3 consecutive laps (without any errors or resets) will be counted towards the final score for the model.
10. The time calculation is based on the stopwatch clicks of 2 referees, in the case of differences smaller than 1 second, the lap time will take the shorter click between 2 referees, in the case of differences larger than 1 second, the lap time will be taken according to recorded camera footage (30 fps capture rate, counting the frame when the front wheel of the vehicle touches the line from the previous lap relative to the current counting lap, to when the front wheel of the vehicle touches the line the current counting lap).

## Guidelines

1. The running speed of the vehicle will be set to 70%-90% during the race (may vary due to competition circumstances).
2. The race track on the day of competition will be completely custom, so do not over fit your model to a single type of racetrack or sections (e.g. only right turns) train your model to fit a wider range of situations.
3. Train your model at least a day before testing, virtual race testing will be provided, so you can also test there.
4. Beware of your free credits, we do not provide training credits for the purpose of this competition, there are student account options that provide more free credits, but use it at your own discretion.
5. Read the rules and the information provided well.
6. Proof of authorship should be a short screen capture video of the process of your submission, from downloading from the dashboard to submitting to the submission form, plus a screenshot of the details of your model. Please try your best to adhere to the rules, keep your sportsmanship, and avoid any methods of foul play.
