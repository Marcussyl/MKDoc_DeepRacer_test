# Reinforcement Learning

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves training agents to make decisions based on trial and error. In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal, which is a scalar value that indicates how well the agent is performing its task.
