# **Rules and Guidelines**

![Rules](img/rules.jpeg){align="center" width="70%"}

## Rules :material-ruler-square-compass:

1. You may only compete with your own Reinforcement Learning models
2. The race will be conducted **in the time trial format** :clock1:, with winners determined as the fastest time on the leaderboard at the end of the race.
3. The end of a lap is defined as the instance when the front wheel of the vehicle touches the finish line, which is the same way the lap starts initially.
4. A total of 5 model submissions per participant is allowed.
5. A total of 10 runs per participant is allowed. The 3 fastest & valid results would be used to determine your time on the competition leaderboard. If the participant is unable to provide 3 valid results, they would be disqualified.
6. Each participant must submit at least 1 model to the host before the competition day. Failure to do so would reduce your model submission count and run count by 1.
7. If the vehicle goes out of the track (4 wheels all touching on the green part of the track at the same time), the run will not be considered as valid. If there are any uncertainty, a re-run will be organized.
8. The time calculation is based on the stopwatch clicks of 2 referees, in the case of differences smaller than 1 second, the lap time will take the shorter click between 2 referees, in the case of differences larger than 1 second, the lap time will be taken according to recorded camera footage (30 fps capture rate, counting the frame when the front wheel of the vehicle touches the line from the previous lap relative to the current counting lap, to when the front wheel of the vehicle touches the line the current counting lap).
9. **Model submission ends at 8pm.** The remaining un-used runs by participants will be considered as invalid.

???+ warning

    - The sharing and the use of shared models are strictly prohibited and will result in disqualification.
    - Sufficient Proof of original authorship of models must be provided if asked. Failure to provide such proof would result in participant disqualification. (See Guideline 2 for Proof of authorship)

## Guidelines :material-book-outline:

1. The running speed of the vehicle will be set to **80%** during the race (may vary due to competition circumstances).
2. The race track on the day of competition will be completely custom, so do not over fit your model to a single type of racetrack or sections (e.g. only right turns) train your model to fit a wider range of situations.
3. Proof of authorship should be a short screen capture video of the process of your submission, from downloading from the dashboard to submitting to the submission form, plus a screenshot of the details of your model. Please try your best to adhere to the rules, keep your sportsmanship, and avoid any methods of foul play.
